## üì® Template: `fb-security-alert.html`

**Description:**  
A fake Facebook login alert email designed to simulate a social engineering scenario where the recipient is warned about an unauthorized login attempt.

**Purpose:**  
To study how users respond to realistic-looking phishing emails and how Gophish tracks interactions like email opens and link clicks.

### üîß Gophish Template Variables Used:
- `{{.Tracker}}`: Inserts an invisible pixel to track when the email is opened.
- `{{.URL}}`: Automatically replaced by Gophish with the unique phishing link for each recipient.
